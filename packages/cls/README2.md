# `@use-pico/cls`

## Introduction ✨ <a id="introduction"></a>

`@use-pico/cls` is a class-first styling system built for modern design systems and production apps. It works with existing CSS utilities (like Tailwind), _not_ CSS-in-JS. Its core ideas are: **design tokens** as first‑class citizens, **multi-slot** components, **explicit variants** with strong TypeScript guarantees, and a powerful **multi-level inheritance** model for scalable systems. ✨

- 🧱 **Contracts, not configs**: declare **tokens · slots · variants** once → get full IntelliSense everywhere
- 🎯 **Design tokens** as first-class citizens with **inheritance** and validation
- 🎛️ **Rules that read like UI**: map variant combos → slot styles with predictable overrides
- 🧩 **Extend anything**: multi‑level inheritance across tokens/slots/variants with types intact
- 🧠 **Type-safety first**: compile‑time checks across contracts, rules, and overrides
- ⚡️ **Lazy by default**: slots are computed on demand via Proxy; no wasted work
- 🚀 **Cached slots**: per-slot memoization; repeated `slot()` calls with identical inputs are near‑zero cost
- 🎨 **Runtime flexibility**: override variants/slots/tokens at `create()` time
- 🌀 **Tailwind‑native**: powered by `tailwind-merge` for sane, deduped class strings
- 📦 **Built for production**: framework‑agnostic, tiny runtime, excellent React integration
- 🧭 **Where this fits**: honest comparison with CVA, TV, Stitches, and vanilla-extract

> **Who is this for**: teams building design systems, component libraries, and apps that want predictable styling with a friendly, type-safe developer experience. 🎯

> **Note**: `cls` is not `CSS‑in‑JS`; it returns class strings and works with your existing CSS (e.g., Tailwind). No runtime style injection. 🚫

## 1. Foundations <a id="1-foundations"></a>

**[← Previous: Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)** | **[→ Next Chapter: Core API](#2-core-api)**

### 1.1 What is CLS? <a id="11-what-is-cls"></a>

So, what exactly is this **CLS** thing? 🤔

**CLS** stands for **Class List System** (because we're creative with acronyms, obviously ✨). But don't let the fancy name fool you – it's basically your friendly neighborhood styling system that decided to be different from all the other kids on the block! 🚀

Think of CLS as that **smart friend** who shows up to a construction site with a perfectly organized toolbox instead of just throwing random tools in a bag 🧰. While other styling libraries are like *"here's a hammer, good luck building a house"*, CLS is like *"here's a blueprint, here are the materials, and here's how they all work together – oh, and everything is type-safe because we're not savages"* 😄.

**What makes CLS special?** 🎯 Well, it's **not** CSS-in-JS (we're not monsters 👹), it's **not** just another utility-first approach (*been there, done that*), and it's definitely **not** one of those *"write CSS in JavaScript strings"* situations (*shudder* 😱). Instead, CLS is a **class-first styling system** that works with your existing CSS utilities like **Tailwind**, but gives you **superpowers** you didn't know you needed! 💪

Imagine you're building a button component. With traditional approaches, you might end up with something like:
```typescript
// The old way (don't do this at home, kids 👶)
const buttonClasses = [
  'px-4', 'py-2', 'rounded', 'bg-blue-500', 'text-white',
  // ... 20 more classes that you hope work together 🤞
].join(' ');
```

But with CLS, you get something **magical** ✨:
```typescript
// The CLS way (where magic happens 🪄)
const Button = cls(contract, definition);
const classes = Button.create(({ what }) => ({
  variant: what.variant({ size: "lg", variant: "primary" })
}));
```

**The best part?** 🎉 You get full **IntelliSense**, **type safety**, and the ability to extend and compose components like you're playing with **LEGO bricks** – but for grown-ups who write code for a living! 🧱

CLS is like having a **design system** that actually *listens* to you, *understands* your needs, and doesn't make you want to pull your hair out when you need to make a simple change 😤. It's the styling system you've been **dreaming of**, even if you didn't know it existed! 💭

So buckle up, because we're about to dive into a world where styling components is actually **fun**, **predictable**, and – dare we say it – **enjoyable**! 🎊

### 1.2 Mental Model <a id="12-mental-model"></a>

Alright, let's talk about the **mental model** behind CLS! 🧠✨

The CLS mental model is built on two powerful pillars: **heavy typechecking** and **contract-first design**. Think of it like building a house – you start with a solid foundation and detailed blueprints, then everything else just flows naturally from there! 🏗️

### **Contract-First: Define Once, Use Everywhere** 📋

In CLS, you start by defining **what's available** down the stream. You decide what tokens, slots, and variants your component will have, and how they all fit together. Once that's done, you can use these building blocks everywhere without wondering what's available! 🎯

```typescript
// Define your contract first (the "menu")
const Button = cls({
  tokens: {
    "color.bg": ["default", "primary", "danger"],
    "color.text": ["default", "primary", "danger"]
  },
  slot: ["root", "label", "icon"],
  variant: {
    size: ["sm", "md", "lg"],
    variant: ["default", "primary", "danger"]
  }
}, definition);
```

**The magic?** Once you define this contract, TypeScript becomes your best friend and knows exactly what's available everywhere! 🎯

### **Heavy Typechecking: Your Safety Net** 🛡️

CLS doesn't just do type checking – it does **heavy typechecking**. We're talking about the kind of type safety that catches mistakes before you even run your code. It's like having a very picky code reviewer who never sleeps and catches every single error! 😴➡️👁️

**Invalid variants?** TypeScript will scream at you! 🚨 **Wrong token names?** Nope, not happening! ❌ **Missing slots?** Forget about it! 🚫 **Type mismatches?** Caught at compile time! 🎯

### **The "Feel It" Philosophy** 🌟

Here's the beautiful part: once you understand the contract-first approach and embrace the type safety, the rest just **feels natural** from the code and design. It's like learning to ride a bike – at first, you're focused on balance and pedaling, but soon you're just cruising and enjoying the ride! 🚴‍♂️

**You'll find yourself thinking:** *"I need a button variant? Let me check the contract!"* 📖 *"What tokens are available? TypeScript will tell me!"* 💡 *"How do I extend this? The extend method knows what to do!"* 🔧

### **Why This Mental Model Works** 🎯

**Predictability**: Everything is defined upfront, so there are no surprises. **Discoverability**: TypeScript IntelliSense shows you exactly what's available. **Consistency**: The same patterns work everywhere in your codebase. **Confidence**: You know your styling will work because the types say so.

It's like having a **GPS for your styling** – you always know where you are, where you can go, and how to get there! 🗺️

So remember: **define your contracts first, let TypeScript be your guide, and trust that the rest will feel natural as you code!** The mental model is simple, but the possibilities are endless! 🚀✨

### 1.3 Installation <a id="13-installation"></a>

> **You're in? Let's install the package, a lot of magic awaits!** ✨🚀

Alright, let's get this party started! 🎉 Installing CLS is as simple as it gets – no complicated setup, no mysterious configuration files, just pure magic waiting to happen!

Ready to see it in action? Jump to [Quick Start](#14-quick-start) to see your first `cls()` call! 🚀

### **TypeScript Ready** 🎯

CLS is built with TypeScript from the ground up, so you get:
- **Full type safety** out of the box
- **IntelliSense** that actually knows what you're doing
- **Compile-time error checking** that saves you from runtime headaches

### **Framework Agnostic** 🌍

While CLS has excellent React integration, it works with:
- **React** (with hooks and HOCs)
- **Vue** (vanilla usage)
- **Svelte** (vanilla usage)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (because why not?)

### **Ready to Rock** 🎸

That's it! No additional setup, no configuration files to create, no mysterious environment variables to set. Just install the package and start building amazing, type-safe components! 

The magic begins as soon as you write your first `cls()` call! ✨

### 1.4 Quick Start <a id="14-quick-start"></a>

Ready to see CLS in action? Let's start with something simple and build up from there! 🚀

### **Your First Component** ✨

Here's a minimal button component to get you started:

```typescript
import { cls } from '@use-pico/cls';

// Define your button
const Button = cls({
  slot: ['root'],
  variant: {
    size: ['sm', 'md', 'lg'],
    variant: ['default', 'primary']
  }
}, ({ what, def }) => ({
  rules: [
    def.root({
      root: what.css(['px-4', 'py-2', 'rounded', 'font-medium'])
    }),
    def.rule(
      what.variant({ size: 'lg' }),
      { root: what.css(['px-6', 'py-3', 'text-lg']) }
    ),
    def.rule(
      what.variant({ variant: 'primary' }),
      { root: what.css(['bg-blue-500', 'text-white']) }
    )
  ],
  defaults: {
    size: 'md',
    variant: 'default'
  }
}));

// Use it!
const classes = Button.create();
console.log(classes.root()); // "px-4 py-2 rounded font-medium"
```

### **What Just Happened?** 🤔

1. **We defined a contract** - slots and variants
2. **We wrote some rules** - basic styles + size/color variations  
3. **We got a working component** - with type safety and IntelliSense!

### **Next Steps** 🎯

This is just the beginning! In the following chapters, you'll learn about:
- **[Tokens](#5-tokens)** for design system values
- **[Inheritance](#8-inheritance)** for extending components
- **[React Integration](#9-react-integration)** for seamless component development
- **[Advanced Features](#12-advanced-features)** for complex use cases

The beauty of CLS is that you can start simple and gradually unlock more powerful features as you need them. No overwhelming complexity upfront – just clean, predictable styling that grows with your needs! ✨

Ready to dive deeper? Let's explore the [Core API](#3-core-api) and see what else CLS can do! 🚀

## 2. Design Philosophy <a id="2-design-philosophy"></a>

**[↑ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)** | **[← Previous Chapter: Foundations](#1-foundations)** | **[→ Next Chapter: Core API](#3-core-api)**

### 2.1 Callbacks Everywhere <a id="21-callbacks-everywhere"></a>

Ever wondered why CLS uses callbacks everywhere? 🤔 Well, it's not because we're trying to make your life complicated – quite the opposite! We're giving you **type-safe tools** that actually know what you're doing! 🎯

### **The Problem with Plain Objects** ❌

Imagine you're writing a component definition. With plain objects, you'd have something like this:

```typescript
// The old way (don't do this!)
const definition = {
  rules: [
    {
      match: { size: 'lg' },  // TypeScript has no idea what this should be
      slot: { root: 'some-classes' }  // What classes? What slots?
    }
  ]
};
```

**What happens?** TypeScript shrugs its shoulders and says "sure, whatever" because it doesn't know what your contract looks like. You could write `{ size: 'xl' }` even though your contract only allows `['sm', 'md', 'lg']`! 😱

### **The CLS Way: Callbacks with Context** ✨

CLS gives you callbacks that receive **type-safe tools** based on your actual contract:

```typescript
const Button = cls(contract, ({ what, def, override }) => {
  // TypeScript knows EXACTLY what you can do here!
  return {
    rules: [
      def.rule(
        what.variant({ size: 'lg' }),  // ✅ Only valid variants allowed
        { root: what.css(['px-6', 'py-3']) }  // ✅ Type-safe slot configuration
      )
    ]
  };
});
```

### **Why This Matters** 🎯

**1. IntelliSense that Actually Works** 💡
- TypeScript knows what variants you can use
- It suggests valid slot names
- It catches typos before you run your code

**2. Compile-Time Safety** 🛡️
- Invalid variants? Error at compile time!
- Wrong slot names? Error at compile time!
- Type mismatches? Error at compile time!

**3. Refactoring Confidence** 🔄
- Change a variant name? TypeScript will find all usages
- Rename a slot? Everything updates automatically
- Modify your contract? All errors show up immediately

### **The Magic of Context** 🌟

When you use a callback, CLS provides you with tools that are **perfectly typed** for your specific contract:

- **`what`** - Knows your tokens, variants, and slots
- **`def`** - Understands your contract structure
- **`override`** - Provides type-safe override patterns

It's like having a **personal assistant** who knows your project inside and out and never lets you make mistakes! 🧠✨

### **Real-World Example** 🚀

```typescript
// Your contract defines what's possible
const contract = {
  variant: { size: ['sm', 'md', 'lg'] }
};

// Your callback gets tools that respect those constraints
cls(contract, ({ what, def }) => {
  return {
    rules: [
      def.rule(
        what.variant({ size: 'lg' }),  // ✅ Valid
        { root: what.css(['px-6']) }
      ),
      def.rule(
        what.variant({ size: 'xl' }),  // ❌ TypeScript error! 'xl' not in contract
        { root: what.css(['px-8']) }
      )
    ]
  };
});
```

**The result?** You get **compile-time safety** without sacrificing **runtime flexibility**. It's the best of both worlds! 🎉

So remember: **callbacks aren't there to make things complicated – they're there to make things bulletproof!** 💪✨

Alright, time to get CLS into your project! 🚀 This is the fun part where we transform your boring old styling setup into something **magical**! ✨

## The Super Simple Installation 🎯

Installing CLS is easier than making a sandwich (and way more satisfying)! 🥪

### Step 1: Pick Your Package Manager 🎲

```bash
# If you're a npm person (no judgment! 😄)
npm install @use-pico/cls

# If you're a yarn person (fancy! 🧶)
yarn add @use-pico/cls

# If you're a pnpm person (efficient! 📦)
pnpm add @use-pico/cls

# If you're a bun person (fast! 🐰)
bun add @use-pico/cls
```

### Step 2: That's It! 🎉

Seriously, that's all you need! CLS is **framework-agnostic** and works with any build system. No configuration files, no complex setup, no "please restart your dev server 47 times" nonsense! 

## What You Get 📦

When you install `@use-pico/cls`, you get:

- **The core `cls()` function** - your new best friend for styling
- **TypeScript types** - because we're not savages
- **React integration** - hooks, HOCs, and all the good stuff
- **Zero dependencies** - it's just you and CLS, no bloat!

## Prerequisites (The Boring Part) 📋

CLS is pretty chill about requirements, but here's what you need:

### TypeScript Support 🎯
CLS is built with TypeScript in mind, so you'll want:
- **TypeScript 4.5+** (for the good type features)
- **A modern editor** (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.) for the IntelliSense magic

### CSS Framework (Optional but Recommended) 🎨
CLS works great with:
- **Tailwind CSS** - the most popular choice
- **Your own utility classes** - if you're feeling creative
- **Any CSS framework** - CLS doesn't discriminate!

## Quick Setup Check ✅

Want to make sure everything is working? Try this in your code:

```typescript
import { cls } from '@use-pico/cls';

// If this doesn't give you a TypeScript error, you're golden! ✨
const TestCls = cls({
  tokens: {
    "color.text": ["default", "primary"]
  },
  slot: ["root"],
  variant: {
    size: ["sm", "md", "lg"]
  }
}, ({ what, def }) => ({
  token: def.token({
    "color.text": {
      default: ["text-gray-900"],
      primary: ["text-blue-600"]
    }
  }),
  rules: [
    def.root({
      root: what.css(["inline-flex", "items-center"])
    })
  ]
}));

// Test it out!
const classes = TestCls.create();
console.log('🎉 CLS is working perfectly!');
console.log('Root classes:', classes.root()); // Should output: "inline-flex items-center"
```

## Troubleshooting (Just in Case) 🔧

### "Module not found" Error
```bash
# Make sure you installed it correctly
npm list @use-pico/cls

# If it's not there, try installing again
npm install @use-pico/cls
```

### TypeScript Complaining
Make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

### "But I want to use it with [insert framework here]"
CLS works with **everything**! React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JS - you name it! The examples in this guide use React, but the core concepts work everywhere.

## What's Next? 🚀

Now that CLS is installed, you're ready for the **real fun**! In the next chapter, we'll build your first CLS module and see the magic happen! 

Get excited - you're about to experience styling that actually makes sense! 🎊
